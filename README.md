Hi there, this is a small web application that i was made esspeccially for my cs50 final project.

You can use this application to improve your english speaking skills. It will give you some random text by that level which you choose. Then you should say it and application will recognize your voice, tell you you were right or not, if not how many words you said wrong etc. Also it will keep those texts which you said right, you can see them in profile page. You can also see your speaking level in that page.
I hope you will like it.

To avoid bugs please use Google chrome or Samsung internet browser.
